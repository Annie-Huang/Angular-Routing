2. Routing Basics
#######################
Importing the Angular Router
- RouterModule.forRoot()
- Declares the router directives
- Manages our route configuration
- Registers the router service
- Used once for the application

@NgModule({
	imports: [
		BrowserModule,
		RouterModule.forRoot([])
	],
	declarations: [
		AppComponent
	],
	bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export classAppModule { }

RouterModule.forChild()
- Declares the router directives
- Manages our route configuration
- Does NOT register the router service
- Used in feature modules


This one will cause delay when serving the data.
	InMemoryWebApiModule.forRoot(ProductData, { delay: 1000 }),

[
	{ path: 'welcome', component: WelcomeComponent },
	{ path: '', redirectTo: 'welcome', pathMatch: 'full'},
	{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
]
to
[
	{ path: 'home', component: WelcomeComponent },
	{ path: 'welcome', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
	{ path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'},
	{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
]

A key point to keep in mind is that the order of the routes in this array matters. 
The router uses a first match wins strategy when matching route paths. 
This means that more specific paths should always be before less specific paths, such as the wildcard path. 

But there is one potential gotcha here. Redirects cannot be chained. The router will do one of these redirects, 
but not both, during one navigation. So if the default route is activated, the route is redirected to the welcome route. 

This imeans, you cannot use '' to redirectTo 'welcome' and then welcome redirectTo 'home'. the '' has to redirect to 'home'

Redirects can be local or absolute. Local redirects replace a single URL segment with a different one, such as our examples here. 
An absolute redirect replaces the entire URL.
