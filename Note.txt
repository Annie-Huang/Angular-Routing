All the rounter path for this system:
http://localhost:4200/welcome

Importing the Angular Router
- RouterModule.forRoot()
- Declares the router directives
- Manages our route configuration
- Registers the router service
- Used once for the application

@NgModule({
	imports: [
		BrowserModule,
		RouterModule.forRoot([])
	],
	declarations: [
		AppComponent
	],
	bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export classAppModule { }

RouterModule.forChild()
- Declares the router directives
- Manages our route configuration
- Does NOT register the router service
- Used in feature modules


This one will cause delay when serving the data.
	InMemoryWebApiModule.forRoot(ProductData, { delay: 1000 }),

[
	{ path: 'welcome', component: WelcomeComponent },
	{ path: '', redirectTo: 'welcome', pathMatch: 'full'},
	{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
]
to
[
	{ path: 'home', component: WelcomeComponent },
	{ path: 'welcome', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
	{ path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'},
	{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
]

A key point to keep in mind is that the order of the routes in this array matters. 
The router uses a first match wins strategy when matching route paths. 
This means that more specific paths should always be before less specific paths, such as the wildcard path. 

But there is one potential gotcha here. Redirects cannot be chained. The router will do one of these redirects, 
but not both, during one navigation. So if the default route is activated, the route is redirected to the welcome route. 

This imeans, you cannot use '' to redirectTo 'welcome' and then welcome redirectTo 'home'. the '' has to redirect to 'home'

Redirects can be local or absolute. Local redirects replace a single URL segment with a different one, such as our examples here. 
An absolute redirect replaces the entire URL.


 Any one outlet can only display one routed component's template at a time.

Change www.mysite.com/APM/welcome (brower) to (server)
from APM/welcome
to APM/index.html
is through Requires Url rewriting. You can google how to do url rewriting in server side.

Using Hash-based Urls
RouterModule.forRoot([...],{ useHash: true })


Basics Checklist: Setting Up
Define the base path	<base href="/">
Import RouterModule
- Use RouterModule.forRoot() for app routes (one time only!)
- Use RouterModule.forChild() for features

Basics Checklist: Configuring Routes
path: Url segment(s) for the route
- No leading slash
- '' for default route; '**' for wildcard route
- Casing matters
component
- Not string name; not enclosed in quotes
- Component must be imported
Order matters!
